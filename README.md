Commands
===========

### check whats going on  
           fab -c .fabricrc print_status

### deploy a new cluster  
          fab -c .fabricrc deploy_cluster:total_nodes=3

### deploy a new cluster using an existing elastic ip for bootstrap/gateway instance  
          fab -c .fabricrc deploy_cluster:total_nodes=3,eip_allocation_id=eipalloc-xxxxxx

### deploy to an existing vpc cluster, it will consider the gateway node to be the bootstrap if there are existing nodes in the cluster, it will attempt to bring the number of  nodes in the cluster to total_nodes  
          fab -c .fabricrc deploy_cluster:total_nodes=3,vpc_id=vpc-xxxxxxxx

#terminate cluster
          fab -c .fabricrc terminate_cluster:vpc_id=vpc-xxxxxxxx
